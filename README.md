# Customer_Churning

OBJECTIVE

Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company.As the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one, maintaining a healthy customer base is important for the success of any business.As customers have multiple options in the telecom industry, the churn rate is particularly high in this industry.Individualized customer retention is difficult because businesses usually have a lot of customers and cannot afford to spend much time on one. The costs would be too high and would outweigh the extra revenue.But if a company could predict in advance which customers are at risk of leaving, they could focus customer retention efforts by directing them solely toward such "high risk" customers.

The main objective of my project was to build a predictive model to generate a prioritized list of customers most vulnerable to churn.

ABOUT DATASET

I used the IBM telecom dataset available from kaggle.com.The raw data contained 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The “Churn” column was my target variable.The classification goal was to predict whether the customer will churn(1/0).
